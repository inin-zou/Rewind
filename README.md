# Rewind

**Turn a photo into a world you can walk into, listen to, and talk with.**

## What is Rewind?

Rewind is an immersive "memory revisiting" app. Users select a photo or video from their album, say *"wish I could go back to that time"*, and the system transforms that moment into a navigable 3D memory world.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Memory** — Pick a photo or video from your album.
2. **3D World Generation** — HY-1.5-WorldPlay reconstructs the scene into an explorable 3D environment.
3. **Walk Through Your Memory** — Move freely through the scene and discover key memory anchor points.
4. **Guided Reflection** — Have a short, voice-based conversation with a calm companion AI for emotional reflection and processing.
5. **Immersive Soundscape** — ElevenLabs generates and mixes ambient audio (ocean waves, street noise, voices) to make the experience feel real.

## Tech Stack

- **HY-1.5-WorldPlay** — Photo/video to explorable 3D world generation
- **ElevenLabs** — Ambient sound generation and mixing (waves, streets, crowds, etc.)
- **Voice AI Companion** — Guided reflection through natural conversation

## Vision

Memories are more than images — they are places, sounds, and feelings. Rewind lets you step back into those moments, not just to see them, but to feel them again and find meaning in them.
